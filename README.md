# Portfolio & Resume

This repository currently hosts my professional resume along with an automated workflow that compiles and releases it as a LaTeX-generated PDF. While it presently focuses on my resume, I plan to expand this repository with more projects and content in the future.

## Resume

- **Directory:** `resume/`
- **Description:** Contains the LaTeX source for my resume.
- **GitHub Action:** An automated workflow compiles the LaTeX document and publishes the resulting PDF to GitHub Releases whenever updates are pushed.
- **Usage:** Simply update the LaTeX files in the `resume/` directory; the GitHub Action will ensure that the latest version of my resume is always available via the Releases section.

## Future Plans

I plan to add more projects and portfolio items to this repository. For now, it serves as the central location for my resume and its automated release process.

## Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rohanbatrain/Portfolio.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Resume Directory**
   ```bash
   cd Portfolio/resume
   ```
3. **Update and Customize**
   - Edit the LaTeX files as needed to update the resume.
   - The GitHub Action will automatically compile and release the updated PDF.
